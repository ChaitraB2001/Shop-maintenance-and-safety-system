Its an arduino project using tinkercad.

Shop maintenance and safety system describes a system of networked,controllable devices that work together to make your shop more comfortable,customized,efficient and secure.The design developed is for the shop maintenance and safety system . It gives the idea of a smart shop . It includes 5 sensors basically the PIR sensor, the photoresistor, the Gas sensor, the force sensor, and the Ultrasonic distance sensor. Each of these sensors perform unique functions which have high significance.
This project gives us the idea of a smart shop. The simple stationery shops next doors can also be the smart shops using the simple ideas from our project, that can not just prove intelligence, but also safe . We all mightâ€™ve seen the above sensors installed in Malls or Supermarkets, but even the regular stationery shops could use this project for the better maintenance and safety from thefts or even fire accidents.
